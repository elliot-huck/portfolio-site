          What do you need to know about me? Well, for starters, I'm a full-stack web developer who is always excited to learn new stuff. And that's not just limited to learning new stuff about programming; in fact, you'd probably have a hard time finding a subject that <span>doesn't</span> pique my interest in some way. A few of my main hobbies are: losing myself in a good book, trying out obscure new board games, playing D&D with friends, and cooking up crazy culinary experiments in the kitchen.

          Originally a Hoosier from Bloomington, Indiana, I came to Nashville to attend college at Vanderbilt University. I graduated with degrees in Economics and Spanish, and I would be happy to tell you more than you could possibly want to know about either of those subjects. After working in customer service and sales roles for a few years, I decided to pursue a career in web development. I was initially drawn to programming by the unique balance of logical problem solving and creative expression. Another wonderful thing that keeps me hooked on web development is that, no matter how much you know, there's always more to learn.

          My main professional values are curiosity, creativity, and clarity. In addition to being a nifty alliteration, these three words are also the best way to describe my approach to any project I tackle. I love to tinker with things and explore innovative ways to improve systems and processes. I also have a passion for communicating information in a way that is clear, honest, and engaging.
